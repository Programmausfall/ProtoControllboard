------------------------------------------

Temperature Sensor that turns on a Fan and LED at 35 degrees Celcius

------------------------------------------

Max7219 support ()

Handcontrollerbreakout (can be snapped of at the edge, look in BOM for more information) for controlls in your Paws/Claws/Hands (you know what i mean)

------------------------------------------

And that were the features, the basic features that you will need to get your Proto running are : Max7219 (and a fan with "Always on" shorted so you dont overheat), the rest is extra funky stuff

now head over to the BOM.md file to see what you need

!!!PINOUTS FOR BOOPSENSOR,MAX7219 AND MIC/MAX9814 ARE BASED ON M16 Studios FIRMWARE!!!
Note : Handbreakout will be featured as a breakaway on the ControllPCB but will be made so you can snap it of/ snap one key of (and they use niche components), but you have to modify the code even more to get for example face/expressionswapping working, i wont do that

!!! PCB HASNT BEEN TESTED YET, WILL DO IT SOON BUT BE CAREFUL WHEN ORDERING/BUILDING !!!
