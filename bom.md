For full features
(i wont feature links but names and values etc)

Arduino Nano V3 (or clone/simular) 

Max7219 8x8 LED Matrixes 

TTP223 Capacative Touchsensor   

Max9814 (Adafruits is what i used)
Resistor = 4.7kOh 0207, 0.6W 1%
Diode = 1N5817 20V 1A DO-41
Cap = RAD LXZ 16/47 / ELKO 47ÂµF 16V

Fan System 
TMP36GT9Z Temperature Sensor
Green LED (Distance between middle of pads are 2,5mm)
220 Ohm Resistor
!Short Pads "Shoft if Temp Controlled"!
(if you are using other color LEDs you need to figure out the Ohm value yourself

SSD1306 OLED (128x64Pixel)(It only reads temp for now so you should also should have the "Fan System" components)

Speaker (use/search you own, idk about Speakers)

Handbreakout
2 / 1 Choc V1 Switches with MBK Lowprofile Keycaps (i would recommend Homing Caps)


That were the components that you will need here are a few additional things recommended for the electronics part :
Solder
Wire (i use flexy cable which i strongly recommend)
Solderingiron (it should have temperature controll but otherwise all should work)
Desolderingpump (the SS02 Engineer is really good)
Electricaltape
Flushcutters
and for Power i use a Powerbank (with a 3D Printed Backpack)
